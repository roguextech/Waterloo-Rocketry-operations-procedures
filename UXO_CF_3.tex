\subsection{Personnel Required}
The test operations team consists of seven personnel:
\begin{checklist}
    \item The \opsfull{} directs operations procedures and communicates with the other test personnel.
    \item The \primaryfull{} is the main system operator. \primary{} operates all manual valves as well as the test control system.
    \item The \secondaryfull{} is the backup for \primary{}, and communicates with OPS. If \primary{} becomes incapacitated, \secondary{} is responsible for removing them from danger.
    \item The \daqfull{} monitors and operates the test data acquisition system.
    \item The \heatfull{} operates the valves for the tank heating system.
    \item \perifull{} and \periifull{} ensure that no unauthorized personnel enter the testing area during test operations.
